      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been real! For the past 5 years, I have slaved at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. And by slaved, I mean s-l-a-v-e-d. I made less money than typical System Administrators/Engineers at my level doing pretty much anything and everything you can imagine to keep the Observatory&amp;rsquo;s HPC environment functioning as best as it could with the EXTREMELY limited budget that we are given to work with after the Science staff have their way with it.</description>
