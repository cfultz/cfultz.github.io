      <description>A New Dawn I hate e-waste. With a passion. So much so that I pulled my old Macbook Pro from the retirement home that was one of my book bags and started the process of installing EndeavourOS. While I know that I could use tools like OpenCore and plenty of patching tools where I could continue to use the Mac using macOS, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of proprietary software being hacked to work on hardware it isn&amp;rsquo;t intended to do so.</description>

      <description>A bit of (personal) history I&amp;rsquo;ve been through many operating systems in my time as a Linux user. I started out (back in the day) with Ubuntu 5.04 that I had to order off the Internet and have it shipped to my house. How insane is that? Of course, I was on dialup a the time (and still not much better&amp;hellip; uploading this to Github using LTE&amp;hellip;) so it would&amp;rsquo;ve been absolutely out of the question for me to even attempt a download of anything more than a few megabytes at the risk of my parents wanting to use the telephone.</description>
