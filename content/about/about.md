# About Caleb
I am a highly experienced Linux System Administrator with over 20 years of experience working in Linux computing environments. Currently, I work as a Tier Three Linux System Administrator at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), where I (attempt to) improve products and services for scientists and the scientific community by utilizing high-throughput computing clusters attached to multi-petabyte Lustre network storage clusters.

As a father to a little boy on the autism spectrum, I've learned that life is full of unexpected twists and turns. But through it all, my family and girlfriend have been my rock. I am proud of my amazing son, who brings us joy and inspiration every day. Together, we're building a life filled with love, laughter, and adventure.

When I'm not geeking out over Linux systems or high-performance computing clusters, you can find me spending time with my family, enjoying the great outdoors, or catching up on my favorite TV shows. As someone who's passionate about making a difference, I'm grateful to work at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, where we're pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and discovery.

I believe that life is too short to waste on anything less than what brings you joy. So here's to embracing our quirks, celebrating our differences, and living life to the fullest. That's me in a nutshell â€“ or rather, a Linux terminal!
